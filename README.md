## Publications

### 1. Towards Understanding Bipolar Disorder Through Social Media and Transformer Models (Mar 2025)

* **Theme:** Application of transformer models (e.g., GPT-4o, LLAMA) to detect bipolar disorder in Reddit data.
* **Findings:** Achieved up to **0.86 F1-score** with strong precision and recall. Frequent misclassification among mental health categories highlights the need for more domain-specific data.

### 2. Robust Medical Crowdfunding Predictions: Leveraging LLMs & Machine Learning (Feb 2025)

* **Theme:** Predicting the success of medical crowdfunding (cancer campaigns) using LLM-extracted features and machine learning.
* **Results:** Gradient Boosting achieved the highest sensitivity (\~0.79). Important predictors: medical severity, emotional tone, and family involvement.

### 3. Evaluating Enhanced LLMs for Precise Mental Health Diagnosis from Clinical Notes (Dec 2024)

* **Theme:** Assessing LLMs (with Retrieval Augmented Generation) on clinical notes for ICD-10-CM mental health code prediction.
* **Conclusion:** LLMs showed limited understanding of diagnostic codes; further integration of diagnostic guidelines is needed.

### 4. MindWatch: Smart AI for Suicide Ideation Detection (Sep 2023)

* **Theme:** Cloud-based AI system using ALBERT, Bio-Clinical BERT, and GPT-3.5 on Reddit data.
* **Performance:** Over **92%** accuracy, precision, and recall; ALBERT achieved **AUC=0.98**. Also includes psychoeducation support using Llama 2.
